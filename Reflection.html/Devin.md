# Reflection

Overall, the project went fine, though there were many setbacks, including limited knowledge in coding and issues with AI not always giving the intended results. During this project, I learned a few key things:

1. **AI is a tool and privilege, not meant to replace human coding.**  
   When experimenting with the limitations of what AI could create, I realized it has many drawbacks—especially with image generation and code integration. Images often looked very AI-generated, and when asked to combine code, AI tended to make unnecessary changes or separate divs into style and CSS.

2. **CSS is a puzzle that has many solutions.**  
   While working with the AI’s code, I discovered that many pieces in the CSS could be disregarded or interchanged. Experimenting with this idea sometimes made the code look messy, but it helped me recognize which parts were truly necessary. The more familiar I became with CSS, the more I learned to streamline my code.

3. **Coding hurts my brain.**  
   With very basic knowledge, coding was extremely challenging. I was often stumped and progress felt slow. At times, I felt like I didn’t learn much, but the struggle was still a learning experience.

## Website Functionality

The website is decently functional. While there are some design errors, none of them harm the general usability. Links work properly, and pages transition quickly (though Wi-Fi speed can vary). So far, there hasn’t been a single broken link, including navigation and buttons.

## Use of AI

I tried not to rely too much on AI. At most, I used it to generate images and some small code snippets I didn’t know how to make yet.  

My partner relied more heavily on AI, which sometimes slowed progress due to incorrect results, non-functioning code, or AI-generated code not working together.  

For me, AI was a **stepping stone**—I used it to see what code was needed, then edited, removed, or added to it as necessary.

## Design & Aesthetics

The website design is comfortable—no elements feel overstimulating or out of place. However, formatting is slightly inconsistent across elements. Most contrasting visuals came from the images, which sometimes didn’t match the overall color scheme.

## Final Reflection

Making a whole website with minimal experience was definitely a challenge, but also enjoyable. It created opportunities to use AI both properly and improperly.  

The challenge was worthwhile—without obstacles, a beginning coder learns slowly, and much previous knowledge can be forgotten without the push to overcome difficulties.
