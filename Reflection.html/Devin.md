# Reflection

Overall the project is fine, though there have been many setbacks including limited knowledge in coding and issues with AI not giving the intended result. During this project I’ve learned a few key things:

1. **AI is a tool and privilege, not meant to replace human coding.**  
   When experimenting with the limitations of what AI could create, I learned it has many drawbacks—especially with its image generation and code integration. Images looked very AI-generated, and when asked to combine codes, it tended to make unnecessary changes or separate the `<div>`s into `<style>` and CSS.

2. **CSS is a puzzle that has many solutions.**  
   When I was working with the AI’s code, I found many things that could be disregarded in the CSS. Some pieces were interchangeable, and I experimented further with this idea in mind. Sometimes this made the code look a little wacky and messy, but the more familiar I became with CSS, the more I realized what was necessary versus unnecessary in my code.

3. **Coding hurts my brain.**  
   It was extremely challenging to code with very basic knowledge. In many cases I was stumped and couldn’t think of anything. Progress was slow, and I often felt like I didn’t learn much.

# Website Functionality

The website is decently functional. There are some design errors, but none of them harm the general functionality. The links work fine, and the pages transition quickly (though Wi-Fi speed does vary). So far there hasn’t been a single broken link, including navigation and buttons.

# Use of AI

Personally, I tried not to use too much AI. At most, I asked for images and some bits of code I didn’t know how to make yet (AI code document, AI stories, AI images and references).  

During this project my partner tried to use mostly AI, which delayed some parts of the project due to incorrect results, non-functioning code, or AI-generated code not working together.  

Generally, I only used AI as a stepping stone to learn what code is necessary to make what I wanted, and I usually edited the AI’s code to remove or add more as needed.

# Design & Aesthetics

The website designs are comfy—no elements are overstimulating or out of place. However, some formatting is slightly different across elements. Most contrasting visuals come from images, which sometimes don’t match the overall color scheme.

# In Final

Making a whole website with minimum experience was definitely a challenge, but I enjoyed it. It presented opportunities to use AI both improperly and properly.  

The challenge was desirable—without challenging a beginning coder, learning slows, and much previous knowledge is forgotten without the push to overcome obstacles.
