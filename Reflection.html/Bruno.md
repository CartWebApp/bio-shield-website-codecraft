# Reflection
## Project Reflection  
My partner, Devin, and I achieved this website by putting effort and being consistent with our work. We used ChatGPT to create some parts of the code that we didnâ€™t know how to do, as well as to generate background information and product prices. Overall, we wrote most of the code based on our own ideas. For image creation, we used **Adobe Firefly**, which produced good results, and for the logo we combined **Photoshop** with **Adobe Illustrator**. To make the team section more realistic, we searched for images of employees on Google instead of relying on AI. Devin completed most of the coding, while I contributed by giving ideas and creating images.

## Website Functionality  
The website works smoothly, with no errors, and all links function properly. The code is mainly written in **HTML** with some **CSS**, making sure the structure is clean and organized. The site loads efficiently and presents no issues for users. Overall, the functionality is positive, allowing users to easily access the information they need.

## Use of AI Tools  
We used multiple AI tools throughout the project:  
- **ChatGPT**: To generate and fix code efficiently.  
- **Firefly**: To create images that matched our descriptions.  
- **Photoshop & Illustrator**: For logo design, since we preferred using our own creativity instead of AI.  

We found that Firefly worked well when we were specific with descriptions. ChatGPT helped us save time and ensured the code worked correctly. The logo reflects our own thoughts and ideas for the company, balancing both AI assistance and personal creativity.

## Design and Aesthetics  
The website design is simple and clean, with **green and white** as the main colors to reflect freshness and sustainability. Images were carefully selected to connect with the topic, creating a cohesive look. The site is well-designed, organized, and includes all necessary information. In addition, the **responsive design** ensures that the website looks and functions well on phones, tablets, and computers.
